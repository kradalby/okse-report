\noindent This report describes the work done in the course IT2901 - Prosjektarbeid i informatikk II. The customer was the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment(denoted FFI) which is a governmental organization responsible for research and development for the Norwegian Armed Forces. The assignment was to make an application that translates between different publish/subscribe protocols used in the Norwegian Armed Forces and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation(denoted NATO). NATO uses the Web Services Notification protocol(WSNotification) as their standard, while the Norwegian Armed Forces also uses other protocols like Advanced Messaging Queuing Protocol (denoted AMQP), Message Queue Telemetry Transport(denoted MQTT) and ZeroMQ. FFI and The Norwegian Armed Forces needed such a broker in order to participate in NATO's federated mission network(denoted FMN). This report mainly focuses on the development process. However, a thorough description of the product is also included.
